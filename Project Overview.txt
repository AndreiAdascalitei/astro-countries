Hi there!

As with any new framework, I initially found it challenging to figure out the right project structure, especially when it comes to deciding when to use React vs Astro, if I should build the grid/card component on Astro or React. 

I began by creating two Astro components: CountryList.astro and CountryCard.astro, along with a React component to handle the toggle functionality. That's when I discovered that Astro components cannot be used inside React components, only vice versa. 

So I ended up by having this structure: 
1. Countries.astro -> we can remove it and move it directly to the index.astro
	- fetching the country data
        - rendering the React component and the ErrorPanel
2. CountriesList.tsx (React)
        - display country grid containing the country cards
        - filters the grid when toggle-ing
3. ErrorPanel.astro
        - show error messages in a card format
        - separate component for reusability
4. getCountries.ts
        - API logic for fetching countries
        - separate utility for reusability
5. *module.scss
        - CSS modules for scoped styles 
        - scss best for organization and maintainability
6. index.astro
 	- the main page. currently used only for rendering <Countries /> 

You can check the timeline (https://github.com/AndreiAdascalitei/astro-countries/activity). I tried to commit after each task was finished. 

Room for improvement: - get rid of react and use plain js for toggle (reduce bundle size). Keep only Astro for rendering the grid/cards. Something like this example: https://digital-expanse.com/tutorials/astro-blog-filters/

Have a great week! 

Looking forward to your feedback!

Thanks, 
Andrei
